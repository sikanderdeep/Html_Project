                        <h2>Content</h2> <br>  <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: torre pendente di Pisa), or simply, the Tower of Pisa ,<br>
                        is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of Pisa Cathedral. It is known for its nearly <br>
                         four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is one of three structures <br>
                         in the Pisa's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), which includes the cathedral and Pisa Baptistry. <br> <br>
               
                         The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183 feet 3 inches) from the ground on the low side <br>
                          and 56.67 m (185 ft 11 in) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0 in). <br>
                           Its weight is estimated at 14,500 tonnes (16,000 short tons).[2] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the <br>
                            seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. <br><br>
                           
                           The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not <br>
                            properly support the structure's weight. It worsened through the completion of construction in the <br>
                             14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[3][4][5] The structure was stabilized by <br>
                             remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.[6]</p>
